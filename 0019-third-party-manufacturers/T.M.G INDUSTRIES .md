# T.M.G INDUSTRIES INC 
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary
TMG industries is a new venture that was inspired by the helium network while TMG INDUSTRIES is a new corporation the people involved have vast experience and knowledge in the technology sector. What TMG INDUSTRIES may lack in years of operation we make up for in our dedication perseverance and over all willingness to do everything we do at the highest level.With the direction helium is going in with validators coming online and leaving miners with less work we plan to focus on building the most optimal light Hotspots.


## Company Information

TMG INDUSTRIES may be the new kid on the block but after we have the opportunity to create hotspots to help power the helium network everyone will see that we are here to stay. We see the great potential for growth and wish to help get more hotspots into more Canadian hands and help spread the word which is helium

## Product Information

CPU:  Quad-Core Cortex-A7 1.6GhZ
Memory (SDRAM): 1GB DDR3
Onboard Storage: TF Card 8BG EMMC FLASH
Onboard Network: 10/100 Ethernet RJ45
Power Source: 5V DC USB OTG
Low level peripheral: 40 Pin Header
LoRa: LoRaWAN® multichannel concentrator module based on SX1308

The plan is to set realistic expectations from the start and to release units in “drops” so first drop 100 units to 250 units to fully see the exact required time to manufacture 100-250 units our aim is to be able to assemble and ship 1000 units a week and that is very realistic and reasonable as we plan to grow significantly after the first drop and will be able to streamline everything. we will provide prototype shortly.



## Customer Support

HowWe will provide support via email and discord directly through our channels and through helium. and will offer a warranty on all light hotspots sold 


## Hardware Security

We will use EMMC storage and are prepared to add more if needed ECC chip could be added if required we plan to make light hotspots and from my understanding this would not be needed.(if this is not the case please let me know and required security measures will be implemented) and will be open to send unit for audit if needed


## Manufacturing Information

We will work with reputable manufacturing companies if needed while we expand however I am confidant that TMG INDUSTRIES will be able to handle the workload.


## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi

## Budget & Capital

We aim to start with a lower volume and will be able to fund everything privately 
100 units should cost around 10000$ and already have intrest in ordering appon approval we have the capital required

## Risks & Challenges

We are a new company and will likely run into a few issues on our way however we will overcome any challenges that arise.  The IC shortage in 2021 would be one of the only challenges that I can see coming up however we will plan accordingly and will never promise to deliver if we can’t we will have constant updates on our site so our customers are never in the dark.
