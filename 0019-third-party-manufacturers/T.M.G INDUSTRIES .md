# T.M.G INDUSTRIES INC 
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary
TMG industries is a new venture that was inspired by the helium network while TMG INDUSTRIES is a new corporation the people involved have vast experience and knowledge in the technology sector. What TMG INDUSTRIES may lack in years of operation we make up for in our dedication perseverance and over all willingness to do everything we do at the highest level.With the direction helium is going in with validators coming online and leaving miners with less work we plan to focus on building the most optimal  Hotspots.


## Company Information

TMG INDUSTRIES may be the new kid on the block but after we have the opportunity to create hotspots to help power the helium network everyone will see that we are here to stay. We see the great potential for growth and wish to help get more hotspots into more Canadian hands and help spread the word which is helium we have not shipped anything as a company howevery personally we are currently in talks with dhl ups and canada post to ensure we get the best rates and reliable shipping that has been laking. 

## Product Information

CPU:  Quad-Core Cortex-A7 1.6GhZ
Memory (SDRAM): 2GB DDR3
Onboard Storage: TF/SD Card 16GB
Onboard Network: 10/100 Ethernet RJ45
Power Source: 5V DC USB OTG
Low level peripheral: 40 Pin Header
LoRa: LoRaWAN® multichannel concentrator module based on SX1308

The plan is to set realistic expectations from the start and to release units in “drops” so first drop 100 to 250 units to fully see the exact required time to manufacture 100-250 units our aim is to be able to assemble and ship 1000 units a week and that is very realistic and reasonable as we plan to grow significantly after the first drop and will be able to streamline everything. we will provide prototype shortly. our current price point is aroud 500-600$ as the cost for sourcing the required components are high once we can get them for a lower price we will lower the price goal is to be around 350-400$ by the end of 2021. We plan to fully integrate to the helium app to offer all features the app has to offer OTA updates WiFi changes ect 


## Customer Support

wWe will provide 24/7 support via email and discord directly through our channels and through helium. and will offer a warranty on all  hotspots sold 


## Hardware Security

We will use sd cards for storage and the ATECC608A chip for encryption we are also looking at other ways to ensure if the sd card is removed it cannot be used nor copied as well so we wil likely use another form of encryption on the boot drive. 


## Manufacturing Information

We will work with reputable manufacturing companies if needed while we expand however I am confidant that TMG INDUSTRIES will be able to handle the workload. we are currently working with rakwirless to sourece the LoRa Concentrator and a few suppliers for the SBC's and at the moment we are out sourcing for our enclosures all will be coming from reliable sources in china however we may move to onshore options if they can meet our standards 


## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi

## Budget & Capital

We aim to start with a lower volume and will be able to fund everything privately 
100 units should cost around 17650-20000$ we currently have a waiting list of around 300units so we will likely ramp up the initial amout of units to meet the demands which will not be a issue. once all orders have been filled we will aim to keep around 1000 assembled units in stock every week depending on demand.

## Risks & Challenges

We are a new company and will likely run into a few issues on our way however we will overcome any challenges that arise.  The IC shortage in 2021 would be one of the only challenges that I can see coming up however we will plan accordingly and will never promise to deliver if we can’t we will have constant updates on our site so our customers are never in the dark.
